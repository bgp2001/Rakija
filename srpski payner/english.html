                <p>Turbo-folk (in recent years referred to as pop-folk or popular folk) is a fusion genre of popular music blending Serbian folk music with other genres such as pop, rock, electronic or even hip-hop. It has similar styles in Greece (Skyladiko), Bulgaria (Chalga), Romania (Manele) and Albania (Tallava). Having mainstream popularity in Serbia, and although closely associated with Serbian performers, the genre is widely popular in Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Montenegro.</p>
                <h3>Background and characteristics</h3>
                <p>Turbo-folk music emerged as a subculture in the countryside in the 1970s, Yugoslavia, before migrating to the city during the eighties and reached expansion in the nineties during the regime of Slobodan Milošević, Yugoslav wars, inflation and political isolation.

The term, coined by rock musician Rambo Amadeus, refers to every folk music based song featuring elements of rock, electronic, dance, pop, hip-hop or other genres not related to true Serbian traditional music. Turkish and Greek folk music have also had great influences, with often cases of plagiarism without consequences due to political situation in Yugoslavia. Songs were primarily composed by acclaimed rock and pop musicians such as Milić Vukašinović, Goran Bregović and Kornelije Kovač with lyrics mainly written by Marina Tucaković. Most of the tracks involve themes of love, mainly adultery and sex, then materialism, alcohol and vice.

The visual image also went through changes and was heading towards MTV aesthetics. Music videos and editorials were mostly directed by former art photographer Dejan Milićević, who himself stated Baroque as his main inspiration. Turbo-folk was predominantly broadcast on RTV Palma and RTV Pink.</p>
				<h3>Performers and popularity</h3>
                <p>The record in sales is held by Lepa Brena, who has sold over 40 million records and held some of the biggest concerts on the Balkans, making her the most successful Serbian singer to date. Brena was also considered to be the symbol of former Yugoslavia, the country's unity and power, and after the breakup of the federation, of so called yugo-nostalgia.


Ceca, arguably the most popular turbo-folk singer
Among various turbo-folk singers in the nineties, arguably the biggest star of the decade was Dragana Mirković, who has sold more than 10 million records. She was at the time signed to Južni Vetar, alongside other popular singers like Mile Kitić, Sinan Sakić and Šemsa Suljaković. However, Svetlana Ceca Ražnatović and Aca Lukas dominated in the late nineties and early two thousands acquiring enormous popularity despite their controversies. Ceca was married to Željko Ražnatović Arkan, war crminal and commander of the Serb Volunteer Guard, while Lukas is known for his troublesome lifestyle involving drug addictions and gambling problems. Both singers were arrested during the operation Sablja in 2003. Jelena Karleuša also rose to prominence in the mid nineties, recognised for her highly sexual image and provocative work. During this period, Croatia also had its own pop-folk stars like Severina and Magazin with its lead singer Jelena Rozga.

In the two thousands, the single-person dominated scene was replaced by diverse performers who remained popular for at least a year. New music and its performers were labeled as pop-folk [performers]. Serbian record label Grand Production gathered almost every singing person in the country, taking monopoly over the music industry with significantn media space for its TV shows, music festivals and magazines. Grand was held responsible for the success of the most of, at the time, popular acts like Seka Aleksić, Indira Radić, Saša Matić, Stoja, Dara Bubamara, Aco Pejović, Viki Miljković, Sanja Đorđević and many more. Popular reality singing competition Zvezde Granda also created many raising stars of pop-folk, such as Milica Todorović, Tanja Savić, Milan Stanković, Rada Manojlović and Milica Pavlović, whose careers were managed by Grand.

In the 2010s, pop-folk embraced even more pop influence and would often infuse electronic or hip-hop, leaning toward club music. Previously an underground hip-hop duo, Elitni Odredi gained enormous popularity after they had commercialised their sound by adding folk music. They were the pioneers of digital age in Serbian music, avoiding mainstream media and used YouTube as their main platform. Bosnian singer Maya Berović, who saw moderate success in two thousands, became really successful when she collaborated with rappers Jala Brat and Buba Corelli on her 2017 album, which was a mixture of contemporary pop-folk.</p>
